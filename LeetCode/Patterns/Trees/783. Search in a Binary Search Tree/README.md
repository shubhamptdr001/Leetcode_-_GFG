### 📜 Problem Description

You are given the  `root`  of a binary search tree (BST) and an integer  `val` .

Find the node in the BST that the node's value equals  `val`  and return the subtree rooted with that node. If such a node does not exist, return  `null` .

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 2
Output: [2,1,3]

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 5
Output: []

```

**Constraints:**

	
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range  `[1, 5000]` .
	
- `1 <= Node.val <= 107`
	
- `root`  is a binary search tree.
	
- `1 <= val <= 107`
